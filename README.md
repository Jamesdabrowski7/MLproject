This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict individual income levels based on demographic and employment features. Utilizing the Adult Income Dataset, the goal is to classify individuals as earning above or below $50K annually.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Generation of plots to visualize data distributions and model performance.
Technologies Used - Programming Language: Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
